**Homework 17, Leaflet Homework**

In this homework, using data from earthquake.usgs.gov, I mapped earthquakes from the past seven days.

Using leaflet I mapped each location of an earthquake with the marker size based on magnitude and the marker color based on depth.

Additionally, I added popups to the markers that have information on the specific earthquake selected.

There is also a legend that shows how the color coordinates to the depth.
